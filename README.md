# README

[CBOR](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7049) is a binary format, which is intended to be
used in-place of JSON, when a fast and more expressive representation of data is needed.

This package adds decoding (reading) of CBOR serialized values to [Cuis Smalltalk](http://cuis-smalltalk.org),
in later versions also encoding (writing) will be added.

# Example of usage

```smalltalk
  filename := '/home/user/projects/cuis-cbor/example.cbor'.

  filename asFileEntry readStreamDo: [:stream |
	stream binary.
	reader := CborReader on: stream.

	reader next ] 
```

For convenience a `example.cbor` is included, which was generated by the ruby cbor gem. The
example above then returns `a Dictionary('foo'->1 'hello'->'from ruby' 'moo'->#(1 2 #(56 89 10)) )`.
